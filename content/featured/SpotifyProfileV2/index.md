Served 1,000+ users with an AI video summarization pipeline that condensed 5-hour talks into 5-minute summaries using keyframe extraction and a custom hybrid clustering algorithm that corrected BERTopicâ€™s non-chronological output via vector similarity and temporal heuristics. Deployed via Docker on AWS EC2.
